			The History of Cellular Phones</h1>
		<p style="class:one;">  
The Telephone (“Phone”) is a telecommunications device that allows 2+ users to conductlong distance conversations.<br>
 Telephones work through cell towers and satellites.<br>
In 1876 a Scottish immigrant by the name of Alexander Graham Bell was granted a patent for the first telephone.<br>
 In the beginning of their history telephone lines were directly connected<br>
to 2 different locations meaning you couldonly talk to that person you are connected to.<br>
 Later on all the telephone lines were connected to a central point.<br>
But to talk to another person, lines would have to be physically connected.</p>

The first mobile phone was introduced to the world in 1973 by Motorola.<br>
These phones were quite like computers and were not directly connected to telephone lines.<br>
 Since the turn of the millennium personal wireless cellphones have taken over the world(Skynet).<br>
These phones are nearly as powerful as a computer and can be put in your pocket.<br>
 In the modern world we live in nearly everyone in North America owns a cell phone.<br>
Numerable companies such as Apple and Samsung run the smartphone world and rip everyone off.<br>
 In fact, over a billion Apple products are currently in use and I can see exactly why.<br>
Portable phones although sometimes overwhelming and extremely expensive are extremely useful.<br>
 They can be used to check up on numerous things such as the weather and can be used to access many sites such as snapchat.<br>

The only major problem besides the odd phone blowing up is that children can be exposed to inappropriate sites.<br>
 Although this is a problem smartphones and cellphones have benefited the world greatly and will be continued to be used by all.</p>
